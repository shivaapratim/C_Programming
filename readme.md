# Pattern Printing Programs in C

A collection of simple C programs to demonstrate various pattern printing techniques for students learning programming fundamentals.

## About This Repository

This repository contains basic pattern printing programs written in C. Each program demonstrates different loop structures and conditional logic concepts that are fundamental to programming.

**Special Thanks to Coding Blocks** for providing excellent learning materials and guidance for students. These programs are inspired by their comprehensive programming courses.

## Pattern Preview

Each program contains a visual representation of the pattern in comments at the top of the file. Here's what you'll find:

- **Pattern 1**: Complete 5×5 matrix of stars
- **Pattern 2**: Lower triangular pattern
- **Pattern 3**: Upper triangular pattern
- **Pattern 30**: Descending number sequences
- **Pattern 31**: Diagonal number pattern with stars

## How to Use

### Step 1: Download or Clone

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/shivaapratim/BCA_FirstSem>
cd patterns
```

### Step 2: Compile and Run

For pattern programs:

```bash
cd patterns
gcc pattern1.c -o pattern1
./pattern1
```

For other programs:

```bash
gcc simpleInterest.c -o simpleInterest
./simpleInterest
```

Repeat for any other .c file you want to run!

## Important Note for GitHub Users

**If you can't see the pattern diagrams clearly in GitHub's interface**, please:

1. **Download the file** or **clone the repository**
2. **Open the .c files in VS Code** or any code editor
3. The ASCII art patterns in comments will be clearly visible

GitHub's web interface sometimes doesn't display comment formatting perfectly, but the patterns are beautifully laid out in actual code editors.

## Learning Objectives

These programs help students understand:

- **Nested Loop Structures**: How inner and outer loops work together
- **Conditional Logic**: Using if-else statements within loops
- **Pattern Recognition**: Mathematical relationships in visual patterns
- **Basic C Syntax**: Variables, loops, and output functions

## For Beginners

Each program is:

- **Self-contained**: No external dependencies
- **Well-commented**: Clear pattern diagrams at the top
- **Simple**: Uses only basic C concepts
- **Educational**: Perfect for learning loop logic

## Questions or Issues?

If you have questions about these patterns or need help understanding the logic, consider:

1. Checking out **[Coding Blocks](https://codingblocks.com/)** for comprehensive programming courses
2. Opening an issue in this repository
3. Reviewing the pattern comments in your preferred code editor
