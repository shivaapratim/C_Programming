C Programming Course End-Semester Examination Guide
This document outlines the scope and expected question types for the end-semester examination. It is intended for instructor use to ensure comprehensive coverage and alignment with course learning outcomes.

Examination Focus
The examination is designed to assess the students' understanding of core C programming concepts, their ability to apply theoretical knowledge, and their skills in constructing practical solutions.

The question distribution will cover multiple-choice questions (MCQs) for foundational concepts and programming questions for application and creation skills.

Core Topics & Question Types
The questions are categorized by topic to ensure all key areas are covered. The structure indicates the Topic -> Sub-Topic -> Types of Questions that can be expected.

1. Introduction to C & Fundamentals
   This section focuses on the basic building blocks of the C language.

Program Structure:

Questions: Purpose of header files (e.g., <stdio.h>), the role of the main() function, and the meaning of the program's return value (e.g., return 0;).

Data Types & Variables:

Questions: Identifying valid variable names, selecting the correct data type (int, float, char, double) for different kinds of data, and knowing the memory size (in bytes) of fundamental data types.

I/O Operations:

Questions: Identifying functions for input (scanf()) and output (printf()), and recognizing correct format specifiers (%d, %f, %c, %s).

Comments:

Questions: Identifying the correct syntax for single-line (//) and multi-line (/_ ... _/) comments.

2. Operators, Expressions, and Control Flow
   Operators:

Questions: Evaluating expressions involving arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, and assignment operators. Understanding operator precedence and associativity.

Conditional Statements (if, if-else, switch):

Questions: Tracing the flow of control in simple and nested if-else blocks. Determining the output of code snippets involving switch statements and fall-through behavior.

Ternary Operator:

Questions: Converting if-else logic into the conditional (ternary) operator and vice-versa.

3. Looping Constructs and Patterns
   This section assesses the ability to implement repetitive tasks and construct visual patterns.

Loops (for, while, do-while):

Questions: Differentiating between the use cases of each loop type. Tracing the output of loops, especially those involving break and continue keywords.

Nested Loops and Patterns:

Questions:

Construction: Write a C program to print various numeric or character patterns (e.g., right-angled triangles, pyramids, counting triangles, mixed symbol patterns).

4. Arrays
   This topic covers the definition, access, and manipulation of linear data structures.

Array Basics:

Questions: Identifying the correct array declaration and initialization syntax. Understanding how array elements are indexed (subscripts) and accessed.

Array Programming Applications (1D and 2D):

Questions:

Standard Algorithms: Write a C program to find the sum/average of elements, reverse an array, or count element frequency.

Positional Logic: Write a C program to find the sum of elements at even and odd positions or even/odd values.

Advanced Manipulation: Write a C program to insert an element into an array at a specific position, or to divide an array's elements into two separate arrays based on a criterion.

5. Strings
   Strings are treated as character arrays, and this section includes both manual manipulation and the use of standard library functions.

String Manipulation (Manual):

Questions:

Character Processing: Write a C program to find the frequency of vowels and consonants separately in a string.

Case Conversion: Write a C program to convert a string to lowercase or uppercase without using built-in functions.

Word/Space Handling: Write a C program to remove all spaces from a string or count the number of words in a string.

Advanced Logic: Write a C program to find the first non-repeating character in a string.

Standard String Functions (<string.h>):

Questions:

MCQs/Program Output: Understanding the purpose and output of functions like strlen(), strcpy(), strncpy(), strcat(), strncat(), strcmp(), strlwr(), and strupr().

6. Functions
   This section focuses on modular programming, function design, and parameter passing.

Function Fundamentals:

Questions: Understanding the components of a function (declaration/prototype, definition, call). Identifying the correct syntax for a function call.

Function Programming Applications:

Questions:

Simple Utility: Write a C program to check whether a number is even or odd using a function.

Return Values: Write a C program to return the reverse of a number using a function.

Calculations: Write a C program to calculate the area of a circle using a function.

Array Passing: Write a C program to find the sum of all array elements using a function (demonstrating array passing).

Recursion (If Covered):

Questions: Tracing the execution and determining the output of simple recursive functions (e.g., factorials, Fibonacci).

Parameter Passing:

Questions: Differentiating between Call by Value and Call by Reference (if pointers are covered for the latter).
